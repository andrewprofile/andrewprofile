My name is Andrzej, and I'm a software developer specialized in building high performance, large scale web applications.

I live in Poland, since 2018 I'm working as Magento, Prestashop, Shopware and WooCommerce Plugin Developer in [@orbitvu](https://github.com/orbitvu/).

Previously, I worked in [@i-systems](https://www.i-systems.net/), and I'm maintaining [@proton-labs](https://github.com/proton-labs) and [@fixcity](https://github.com/fixcity).

I'm interested in all aspects of technology related to web development. I strongly believe in the power of technology to improve people's everyday life and create a more sustainable, accessible and inclusive world.
